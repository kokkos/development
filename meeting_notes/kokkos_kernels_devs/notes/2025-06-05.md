## Nightly Testing

  - CDash at https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Kokkos+Kernels

## Documentation, Communication Structures

  - Review documentation propose in PR [#2643](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2643) --> Luc rewriting file by file
  - Plan to move `example/wiki` to `example/docs` as it might make more sense?

## Release

- 4.7.0 release upcoming (end of August)
- Is there any specific items you need/want ahead of the release?
  - Junchao:
    - Can we have testing on Aurora ahead of the release?
    - Luc: yes, reuse cdash, actually let us setup a nightly build of PETSc against Kokkos Core/Kernels develop version in the kokkos_math project 
    - fix failing tests on Aurora
    - rocSparse support for sparse triangular solve (no progress yet)
    - oneMKL support for sparse triangular solve as well if possible (no progress yet)

  - Luc:
    - get benchmark running daily on Aurora and Frontier, currently adding features to Kokkos Kernels CMake to help with this
    - design a dashboard to report performance results, started with google charts
   
  - Yuuichi:
    - want to have batched documentation ready for 5.0.0

#### To Discuss / Resolve

- Issue [#2622](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2622)
  - It looks like two different failure: one triggered by [#2568](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2568) and [#2580](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2580)
  - One issue is related to the extent returned with a rank 0 view see PR [#2667](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2667)

- refactoring TeamVectorGEMM:
  - PR [#2628](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2628)

- trsv hermitian blocked algorithm
  - PR [#2651](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2651), waiting for work on issue #2622 to be resolved before merging

- gbtrs/grbtrf exmaples in PR [#2664](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2664)

- Yuuichi want to add some documentation for batched banded solvers and related utilities

- refactoring TPL build system
  - Clean-up call to library ALIAS to fix issue reported by users, see PR [#2652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2652)
  - Remove logic that include TPL into the kokkos:: namespace and instead introduce them in kokkoskernels::
