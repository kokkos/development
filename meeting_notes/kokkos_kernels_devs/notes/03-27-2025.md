#### To Discuss / Resolve

- refactoring sptrsv eti/tpls:
  - different function signatures for no-TPL vs TPL code path --> not portable.
  - current organization of the TPL path makes it difficult to effectively reuse the symbolic step.
  - only cusparse supported, no rocsparse wrapper so far.
- refactoring TPL build system
  - will prioritize using find_package() logic
  - cleaning up issue with namespace to comply with Trilinos external packages policy
  - hopefully the two above will help fixing issues with KK build with rocm TPLs using spack
