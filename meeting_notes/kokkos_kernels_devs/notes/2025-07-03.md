## Community
  
- **Scientific Meetings / Training / Hackathons**

## Nightly Testing

  - CDash at https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Kokkos+Kernels
  - Making some progress clearing issues in unit-tests, trying to assess if unordered queue is the culprit. Some fences are potentially missing as well.
  - Will add a build for latest releases of Core and Kernels against latest compiler.
  - Junchao: could we have more patch releases when issues are discovered and fixed for instance when new compilers are installed. For instance bringing: PR [#2615](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2615) and [#2688](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2688) and Core PR [#8051](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8051)

  - Fixed issue with Polaris, now turning on benchmark tests to monitor performance.
  - 

## Documentation, Communication Structures

  - Review documentation propose in PR [#2643](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2643) --> Luc rewriting file by file
  - Plan to move `example/wiki` to `example/docs` as it might make more sense?
  - Review documentation for pttrf/pttrs in PR [#2678](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2678)

## Release

- 4.7.0 release upcoming (end of August)
- Is there any specific items you need/want ahead of the release?
  - rocSparse support for sparse triangular solve (no progress yet)
  - oneMKL support for sparse triangular solve as well if possible (no progress yet)
  - design a dashboard to report performance results, started with google charts --> some progress here, working on it in my fork
  - get benchmark running daily on Aurora and Frontier --> adding them on Polaris as a start, need to push results somewhere...
  - want to have batched documentation ready for 5.0.0

#### To Discuss / Resolve

- Issue [#2622](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2622)
  - It looks like two different failure: one triggered by [#2568](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2568) and [#2580](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2580)
  - One issue is related to the extent returned with a rank 0 view see PR [#2667](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2667)

- refactoring TeamVectorGEMM:
  - PR [#2628](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2628)

- trsv hermitian blocked algorithm
  - PR [#2651](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2651), waiting for work on issue #2622 to be resolved before merging

- Yuuichi want to add some documentation for batched banded solvers and related utilities

- refactoring TPL build system
  - Clean-up call to library ALIAS to fix issue reported by users, see PR [#2652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2652)
  - Remove logic that include TPL into the kokkos:: namespace and instead introduce them in kokkoskernels::
 
- Junchao:
  - Kokkos does not support "big binnaries", i.e. you only compile for a single CUDA architecture. --> Luc will discuss this at leader's meeting on Monday

- Hari:
  - working on benchmarking the library on A500 GPU within the "Trust platform" a library for CFD simulations.
  - with Remi, creating a solver market that would allow you to pick solvers between different libraries.
  - having an issue with Tacho, a link error happening with CUDA backend.
  - trilinos getting started tutorials are not kept up to date.
  - interested in cuDSS for Trust.
  - RCM reordering in Kokkos Kernels with GMRES, comparing AMGX with ILU, slow convergence observed with ILU.

#### Current issues:


## Notes:

 - Junchao: is Kokkos Kernels considering sparse direct solver TPLs (cuDSS)? --> also used at CEA so second user for CFD
 - Yuuichi: CEA is interested as well.
 - Luc: looking into it but no final decision yet.
 - Yuuichi: is there a Kokkos Kernels paper in preparation?
 - Luc: yes, it is almost ready and we are aiming to submit it in July.
