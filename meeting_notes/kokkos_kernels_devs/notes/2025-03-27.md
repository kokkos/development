## Documentation, Communication Structures

  - Documentation now required by github action when making PRs

## Release

- 4.6.0 release tentatively today, although it might wait until Monday for a change in Trilinos...
- Release briefing upcoming in a couple of weeks: 

#### To Discuss / Resolve

- refactoring:
  - [2555](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2555): Refactor batched serial pttrs implementation details and tests

- refactoring sptrsv eti/tpls:
  - different function signatures for no-TPL vs TPL code path --> not portable.
  - current organization of the TPL path makes it difficult to effectively reuse the symbolic step.
  - only cusparse supported, no rocsparse wrapper so far.

- refactoring TPL build system
  - will prioritize using find_package() logic
  - cleaning up issue with namespace to comply with Trilinos external packages policy
  - hopefully the two above will help fixing issues with KK build with rocm TPLs using spack

#### Current issues:

- Yuuichi: documentation for kokkos-batched

- Yuuichi: error analysis for unit-testing

- Junchao: lack of TPL support for ILU and missing rocSPARSE and MKL support for sparse TRSV
