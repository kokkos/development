## Attendance

Luc, Colleen, ~~Yuuichi,~~ Junchao, Daniel


## CI testing

Luc: propose three new CI builds (still ongoing discussion with the team)
 - CUDA 13
 - ENABLE_COMPILE_AS_CMAKE_LANGUAGE for CUDA and/or HIP
 - RDC
 - Tried ETI_ONLY=OFF but generated too many tests, will have to re-work that

Daniel: would like to be able to have a build with NO_ETI=ON and ETI_ONLY=OFF so that the number of symbols generated is reduced for debugging purpose.
        The MACRO: `KOKKOSKERNELS_IMPL_CHECK_ETI_CALLS`

Junchao: Did a build with CUDA 13.1 and got some build errors in Kokkos Core.
         Daniel: will have a look, need to get a new container with the proper toolchain to test

## Nightly testing

Luc: will work on the ilu benchmark to remove that failure on the dashboard.

Colleen: Prior issue in BLAS resolved after Daniel's PR.

## Releases

Release plan: 4.7.02 released last week, 5.0.1 coming before Christmas

## Discussion

Colleen: will have a new toolchain from Intel, testing will be done and module should be available. One bug was fixed in it for the scan operation
