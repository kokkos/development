## Attendance

Luc, Colleen, Yuuichi, Junchao, Daniel

Luc: will be absent from Nov 22nd to Dec 6th, some of us might also attend SC25 in two weeks

## CI testing

Luc: propose three new CI builds
 - CUDA 13
 - ENABLE_COMPILE_AS_CMAKE_LANGUAGE for CUDA and/or HIP
 - RDC

Junchao: what is ENABLE_COMPILE_AS_CMAKE_LANGUAGE?
Luc: Let CMake knows the language, handles multiple compilers better

Luc: At least one in Kokkos/Trillinos Nightly turns on RDC.
Junchao: The MOOSE project, which is a Petsc user, wants this feature.

## Nightly testing

Luc: Jim is working at the ilu benchmark, a fix should arrive soon, I will look at the GEMM benchmark

Colleen: After [Kokkos commit] (kokkos/kokkos@4244594), a blas dot CI starts to fail. Can be intel bug?
Luc: will ask Daniel and Chrisitian about this PR

## Releases

Junchao found an issue in PETSc while testing with the KK 5.0 release candidate, will reach out if need a fix in Core or Kernels

Release plan: next week
Release briefing plan: Thanksgiving week

Luc: Intrepid2 passes DynRankView to some batched function, we need to relax the static assertion on `Kokkos::is_view_v`

Luc: Reverted changes introduced to support Conjugate transpose mode in GEMM, see PR [#2829](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2829) and re-introduced `get_extent` and `get_stride` utility functions.

Yuuichi: will Kokkos Kernels 5.0 compile with c++20 and c++17?

Luc: KK will have the same C++ minimum as Kokkos but it should be possible to build against 4.7 and 5.0.
