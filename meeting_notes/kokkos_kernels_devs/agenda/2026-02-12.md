## Community
  
- HPSF Community Summit 2026: Feb 25th-27th 2026 at TU Braunschweig
- HPSF conference March 16th~20th in Chicago

## Testing

### CI

- Some progress on CUDA 13 CI: looking at using SNL GH machine
- Added a CUDA debug build recently, might move it to a different machine
- Would also like to have a Kokkos_ENABLE_COMPILE_AS_CMAKE_LANGUAGE build
- One more for RDC (rellocatable device code) for good measure...

### Nightly

- [Kokkos Kernels](https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Kokkos+Kernels)' CDash

## Documentation, Communication Structures

- Will add PR to make tables for Sparse algorithms and show TPL support on the index page (Should be ready for 5.0!)
- Will add PR to document gesv and svd
- Need to add a PR to document sparse batched kernels
- In general more explanations about TPL support would be nice: what type combination lead to TPL, how are we supporting analyze/compute phases, etc...

## Release

### 5.1.0

- Is there any specific items you need/want ahead of the release?
- regrets from 5.0.0
  - rocSparse support for sparse triangular solve (5.1.0), Ichi working on it
  - oneMKL support for sparse triangular solve as well (5.1.0) Luc starting
- Lapack: GEQRF and UNMQR support
- Sparse: ELLPACK format support in experimental mode
- Support for Apple Accelerate in BLAS, LAPACK upcoming soon
- Look at more ArmPL support in conjunction with CI work

#### To Discuss / Resolve

- Issue [#2622](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2622)
  - Partially resolved, need to look at what triggers failures when enabling ARCH SKX

- refactoring TeamVectorGEMM:
  - PR [#2628](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2628)

- trsv hermitian blocked algorithm
  - PR [#2651](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2651), waiting for work on issue #2622 to be resolved before merging

- refactoring TPL build system
  - Remove logic that include TPL into the kokkos:: namespace and instead introduce them in kokkoskernels::
