## Community
  
- **Scientific Meetings / Training / Hackathons**

## Testing

### CI

- Will look at CUDA 13 support adding a CI test for Kernels.
- Would also like to have a Kokkos_ENABLE_COMPILE_AS_CMAKE_LANGUAGE build
- One more for RDC (rellocatable device code) for good measure...

### Nightly

  - [Kokkos Kernels](https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Kokkos+Kernels)' CDash

## Documentation, Communication Structures

  - Making this meeting's notes public on kokkos.org
    - Meeting agendas are [here](github.com/kokkos/development/meeting_notes/kokkos_kernels_devs/notes) and notes are [here](github.com/kokkos/development/meeting_notes/kokkos_kernels_devs/notes)
  - Plan to move `example/wiki` to `example/docs` as it might make more sense? (Still TBD)
  - Will add PR to make tables for Sparse algorithms and show TPL support on the index page (Should be ready for 5.0!)
  - Will add PR to document gesv and svd
  - Need to add a PR to document sparse batched kernels
  - In general more explanations about TPL support would be nice: what type combination lead to TPL, how are we supporting analyze/compute phases, etc...
  - Yuuichi: adding [iamax](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2804) documentation and [trsv](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2830) examples (both done)

## Release

### 5.0.0

- Release candidate branches are up for [Core](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/tree/release-candidate-5.0.0) and [Kernels](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/tree/release-candidate-5.0.0)
- Initial testing against Trilinos in PR [#14666](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/pull/14666)
- Will stop merging back to master after the release and will likely delete the master branch as a result
- Prioritize fixing the gemm transpose conjugate problem related to issue [#2622](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2622) -> active debugging underway

- want to have batched documentation ready for 5.0.0 --> Yuuichi making good progress, most new function implemented are documented, will look at some older features to add documentation.
- Starting to upgrade CI for full c++20 support only one image needed for testing with gcc/10.5.0

### 5.1.0

- Is there any specific items you need/want ahead of the release? (regrets from 5.0.0)
  - rocSparse support for sparse triangular solve (5.1.0), Ichi working on it
  - oneMKL support for sparse triangular solve as well (5.1.0) Luc starting

#### To Discuss / Resolve

- Issue [#2622](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/issues/2622)
  - Sub issue related to gemm transpose conjugate will target a resolution in 5.0.0

- refactoring TeamVectorGEMM:
  - PR [#2628](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2628)

- trsv hermitian blocked algorithm
  - PR [#2651](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels/pull/2651), waiting for work on issue #2622 to be resolved before merging

- refactoring TPL build system
  - Remove logic that include TPL into the kokkos:: namespace and instead introduce them in kokkoskernels::
  - New logic in PR for BLAS support using CMake package, currently testing it with Apple Accelerate
  - Support for AMD AOCL (CPU libraries) for PETSc customer (easy to do for BLAS, sparse will need more time)
