## WG Build and Packaging

### General

- Cedric Jakob as leaders, have to update the webpage

- Notes on `development`

- Need to define a clearer roadmap for the wg. I will setup a github kanban to track ideas and set up their priorities.
Beginning of the list:
  + cleaning up Kokkos recipe
  + cleaning up Kokkos Kernels recipe
  + mdspan as a dependency
  + `+wrapper` for hipcc?
  + Kokkos ecosystem without compiler wrapper?
 
### Packaging

- We should check if we can rely on CUDA/HIP/CMAKE packages in Spack to create a Kokkos package. This way downstream packages do not have to repeat all the configuration options in their recipes: [Have Kokkos inherit options from upstream packages #2513](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/issues/2513).


#### Spack

PR:

- [kokkos: cxxstd cleanup](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/2721)

- [Kokkos release v5 #2385](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/2385)

- [Kokkos: Fix standalone test #890](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/890)
    Should be ok for now, perhaps not enough for all HIP or CUDA cases but OK for our Kokkos CI.

Issues:


### Build

- CMake and modules

## Notes

- CPP standards in recepies: Richard Berger: we want to make them more like a >c++20 and not propagate a fixed standard. We basically want to express a range that we support and dependencies can select which ones they require.
- Godbolt integration of Kokkos. **Assignee: Cedric** to take a look an report back.
  What is exactly not working?
