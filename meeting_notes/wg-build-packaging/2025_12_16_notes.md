## WG Build and Packaging

### General

- Cedric Jakob as leaders, have to update the webpage

- Notes on `development`

- Need to define a clearer roadmap for the wg. I will setup a github kanban to track ideas and set up their priorities.
Beginning of the list:
  + cleaning up Kokkos recipe
  + cleaning up Kokkos Kernels recipe
  + mdspan as a dependency
  + `+wrapper` for hipcc?
  + Kokkos ecosystem without compiler wrapper?
 
### Packaging

- We should check if we can rely on CUDA/HIP/CMAKE packages in Spack to create a Kokkos package. This way downstream packages do not have to repeat all the configuration options in their recipes: [Have Kokkos inherit options from upstream packages #2513](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/issues/2513).


#### Spack

PR:

- [kokkos: cxxstd cleanup](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/2721)

- [Kokkos release v5 #2385](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/2385)

- [Kokkos: Fix standalone test #890](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/890)
    Should be ok for now, perhaps not enough for all HIP or CUDA cases but OK for our Kokkos CI.

Issues:


### Build

- CMake and modules

## Notes

- Update webpage for WG: **Assignee: Jakob**
- Notes are not public on kokkos/development
- Cedric is working on a TODO board but can not make it public for now. We will try to find a solution for that. Will fall back to putting ideas into the notes/development repo. **Assignee: Luc for looking into how to handle this in the development repo**

- CPP standards in recepies: Richard Berger: we want to make them more like a >c++20 and not propagate a fixed standard. We basically want to express a range that we support and dependencies can select which ones they require. PR: https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/2721 fixes this. **Assingee: ALL to review**
- https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/2385 was merged.
- Luc: Do we want a range of versions which we support an have a policy on that. Cedric, Thomas: We should flag deprecated versions when we don't support them anymore e.g. 4.6.2 should be deprecated when 4.6.3 is out. But we have no control over when spack is removing deprecated versions. We need to reach out to spack developers to get some insight on what `deprecated` means. **Assignee: Cedric**
- Kokkos recipe pulling options from upstream: Our libraries (fft, etc.) are already refering to kokkos. We as WG need to find our stance on this issue.
- Nils: Kokkos binary package in debian is currently provided via trilinos. https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1122987 and https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=kokkos&suite=sid Nils wants to have a separate Kokkos package which makes sense (not bundling it with trilinos). For host only this should work. Every host-arch should have a separate binary but for device this will be problematic. Luc: Kokkos should be a separate package.
