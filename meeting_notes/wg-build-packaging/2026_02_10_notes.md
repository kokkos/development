## WG Build and Packaging

### General
- Presentation at upcoming HPSF. Jakob will need input for the slides.
- Need to define a clearer roadmap for the wg. I will setup a github kanban to track ideas and set up their priorities.
Beginning of the list:
  + cleaning up Kokkos recipe
  + cleaning up Kokkos Kernels recipe
  + mdspan as a dependency
  + removing nvcc_wrapper in Spack?
  + `+wrapper` for hipcc?
  + Kokkos ecosystem without compiler wrapper?
  + More install methods via package managers https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-core-wiki/pull/662
 
### Packaging

- In general we should come up with a plan how to support/integrate into any kind of package manager, including binary ones.
- What to do with the misuse of CMake components: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8698


#### Spack

PR:

- [kokkos: bring back deprecated_code variant #3154](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/3154)

- [Kokkos-FFT: version 1.0.0 #3133](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/3133) merged

- [\[kokkos\]: version 5.0.2 #3269](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/3269) merged

Issues:

- mdspan as a dependency: not high priority but we should allow it in the future

- kokkos-nvcc-wrapper removal in Spack?
