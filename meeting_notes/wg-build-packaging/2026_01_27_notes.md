## WG Build and Packaging

### General

- Need to define a clearer roadmap for the wg. I will setup a github kanban to track ideas and set up their priorities.
Beginning of the list:
  + cleaning up Kokkos recipe
  + cleaning up Kokkos Kernels recipe
  + mdspan as a dependency
  + removing nvcc_wrapper in Spack?
  + `+wrapper` for hipcc?
  + Kokkos ecosystem without compiler wrapper?
  + More install methods via package managers https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-core-wiki/pull/662
 
### Packaging

- We should check if we can rely on CUDA/HIP/CMAKE packages in Spack to create a Kokkos package. This way downstream packages do not have to repeat all the configuration options in their recipes: [Have Kokkos inherit options from upstream packages #2513](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/issues/2513). See [specific meeting](./2026_01_19_kokkos_spack_recipe.md).
- In general we should come up with a plan how to support/integrate into any kind of package manager, including binary ones.
- What to do with the misuse of CMake components: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8698


#### Spack

PR:

- [Kokkos-FFT: version 1.0.0](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/3133): Merged

- [Kokkos: version 5.0.1](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/3135): Merged
    We need to update the release checklist to include Spack packaging. We also need to put together a checklist on how to update Kokkos recipes (nvcc wrapper, Kokkos Kernels strict dependency, ...)

- [Kokkos: Fix standalone test #890](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/pull/890)
    Not a great idea to do it like this, no full support of toolchain except duplicating all the dependencies. We need to define the goal of this test: compiling or just running something built with Spack.

Issues:


### Build

- CMake and modules

## Notes

- CC: I do not think CPack is really interesting for us
- Thomas: Draft a checklist for Spack releases
