### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)
  - Refactoring of device iterate tile https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638
    * PR completely ready for review (asymmetric thread mapping issue addressed), drastically reduces the register pressures (Highest priority)
  - Iterating in MDRangePolicy without tiles for Serial backend https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8721
    * People's thoughts are needed
    * Identified that the performace issue stems from vectorization. Please, refer to these comments in issue [\#8652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652):  [3642147546](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3642147546), [3649050316](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3649050316), [3664601865](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3664601865)

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
    * Demonstrate the differences between host and device reduction capabilities for these edge cases. (Stalled)
  - "Local" unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- MDRangePolicy benchmarks
  - Stream like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8462
      * PR updated using the macro to disable heavy benchmarks (Priority)
  - Stencil like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8458 (Merged)
   
- Support for ROCm 7.1
  - What do we want to do with hipAsyncMalloc: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8708
  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - JOSS Kokkos 4 paper
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)
