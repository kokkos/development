### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)
  - Refactoring of device iterate tile https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638
    * PR completely ready for review (asymmetric thread mapping issue addressed), drastically reduces the register pressures (Highest priority)
  - Iterating in MDRangePolicy without tiles for Serial backend https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8721
    * People's thoughts are needed
    * Identified that the performace issue stems from vectorization. Please, refer to these comments in issue [\#8652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652):  [3642147546](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3642147546), [3649050316](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3649050316), [3664601865](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3664601865)

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
    * Demonstrate the differences between host and device reduction capabilities for these edge cases. (Stalled)
  - "Local" unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- MDRangePolicy benchmarks
  - Stream like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8462
      * PR updated using the macro to disable heavy benchmarks (Priority)
  - Stencil like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8458 (Merged)
   
- Support for ROCm 7.1
  - What do we want to do with hipAsyncMalloc: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8708
  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - JOSS Kokkos 4 paper
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)

## Notes

### General:

  - Please join the mailing lists, we want to be able to keep track of people that are working on Kokkos.

  - Braunschweig: Daniel - submissions will be due end of January

  - HPSF Chicago: Jan 11 or 12 submission deadline. Goal to publish agenda Jan 25. Conrad and committee will work on reviewing submissions

  - Next meeting: 2nd week of January, following vacation + holidays

### CI:

  - HPSF GH200 timeout issues. Assignee: Nathan will try to reproduce

  - Removed Benchmarks from Jenkins CI, improvement to CI test time

  - NERSC nightly job updates. Assignee: Rahul will join next ci wg meeting to discuss, new Cuda builds will be of interest


### 5.0.1:

- Include: [mdspan update PR 8750](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8750) Assignee: Nathan will cherry-pick to release-candidate-5.0.1

- Include: [mdspan update mdspan PR 443](https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/pull/443) Assignee: Nathan will snapshot to kokkos for PR, follow-up cherry-pick to release-candidate-5.0.1

- Include: disable of memoryasync with rocm/7.1 [PR 8746](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8746). Assignee: Jakob will address version checks, cherry-pick to release-candidate-5.0.1
  - Concern about issue persisting into future releases e.g. rocm/7.2, suggestion to modify the check to exclude rocm version >= 7.1 (possibly even 7.0)
  - Approach is to disable memoryasync by default, print warning for users
 
- Include: DynamicView HostMirror deprecation [PR 8762](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8762). Assignee: Conrad to cherry-pick to release-candidate-5.0.1


### Discussion:

- HPSF and KUG presentation ideas discussion
  - Daniel:
    - CI proposal. Suggestions to include Trilinos integration content as additional/secondary layer of testing, will discuss in the next CI WG
  - Jakob:
    - Performance portable design patterns
      - Gather patterns in a "gallery" style for users to browse for potential use matches
      - HPSF presentation could help to request additional contributions
    - HMM:
      - Suggestions: discuss MI300 situation
      - Additional contributions from team are welcome
    - mdspan interop (Python focus):
      - Motivated by ML/AI pushing into big frameworks, can this be done with compatibility layer for Python use?
      - Suggestions: broader HPSF developer audience instead of KUG? Include Nic (on vacation til Jan), possibly LANL folks with Fortran+View interop perspective
  - Carl:
    - Codesign: how we collaborate with vendors, lessons learned, necessary collaborations and timing may influence the vendors path
    - Suggestions: broader HPSF developer audience; a KUG talk could shift focus to include more Kokkos specifics. Include Bruno with Frontier AMD perspective
