## 4.7.2 Release
  - Span of 0-sized, padded views produces incorrect values: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8460

## 5.0 CI and Code Prep

  [Kokkos-5.0 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8265)
  
  ### Themes ###
  - Ensure OpenMP's partition_space doesn't fail for small concurrency: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8488
  - Improve mdspan-based View implementation wrt compatibility with Trilinos (custom layouts?)
  - Desul atomics: Split always_lock_free into host and device versions: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8511
  - Introduce implicit integer precision access operator for View: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8476
  - C++20 modules support: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8263 (Core)

  ### Release Planning
  - Next week release candidate
  - Release Manager: Trevis

## To Discuss / Resolve

approved pull requests: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved
  
#### Deprecation rule

- we allow some low impact deprecations to be in 5.0 new but marked as deprecated 4
  - the will be removed in some minor 5.x release later
  - case by case judgment call
  - done before in 4.0
- Need to do more of the API review

### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - JOSS Kokkos 4 paper
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Inerop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)
