## 4.7.2 Release
  - Span of 0-sized, padded views produces incorrect values: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8460
  - Fix compiling with nvcc-13 and C++20: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8562

## 5.0 CI and Code Prep

  [Kokkos-5.0 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8265)
  
  ### Themes ###
  - Ensure OpenMP's partition_space doesn't fail for small concurrency: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8488
  - Improve mdspan-based View implementation wrt compatibility with Trilinos (custom layouts?)
  - Desul atomics: Split always_lock_free into host and device versions: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8511
  - Introduce implicit integer precision access operator for View: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8476
  - C++20 modules support: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8263 (Core)

  ### Release Planning
  - Next week release candidate
  - Release Manager: Trevis

## To Discuss / Resolve

approved pull requests: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved
  
#### Deprecation rule

- we allow some low impact deprecations to be in 5.0 new but marked as deprecated 4
  - the will be removed in some minor 5.x release later
  - case by case judgment call
  - done before in 4.0
- Need to do more of the API review

### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - JOSS Kokkos 4 paper
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Inerop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)

## Notes
- Kokkos 5.0 release, mostly where we want to be. The following block promotion:
  - PR 8584
    - reverting 8556 which was breaking Trilinos cuda12 build, issue still unknown, maybe compiler bug.
    - Damien: asking for ranges include to be put back in
    - Christian: add all includes back to Cuda and Serial to test
    - Nathan: ranges include was confirmed causing the issue
  - PR 8459
  - PR 8038: Needs reviews
  - Hoping to get release candidate today
- Testing
  - Damien: SNL needs a representative for CI working group
  - SYCL runs not going through, queue too long, Damien will comment on HPSF working group
- HSPF Conference
  - Need draft CFP by end of next week
  - Volunteers to work on this:
    - Conrad
    - Damien will send some folks from ORNL
    - Patrick
    - Luc will get someone from KokkosKernels
  - Conrad will meet with Christian and Damien today to discuss steps moving forward
- Release Briefing
  - Daniel: we don't have access to branch to push slides
  - Damien: we should change default to grant access to push to PRs
  - Christian or Damien will correct this today
- Damien: Should we revisit TeamPolicy scratch size being static?
  - Damien: Semantically incorrect that device properties are static
  - Damien: Being static requires every execution space to share props, in multi gpu context
  - Daniel: MultiGPU assumes all same arch
  - Damien: Sure, but you could still have different properties among GPUs
  - Christian: Scratch size tied to L1 cache, which is static on chip
  - Damien: In theory we could have different props, in practice probably not too impactful
  - Christian: probably should kick it down the road since it's not a problem now
- Yuuichi: MDRangePolicy perf
  - Christian: We should test making the default to be no tiling
  - Christian: Attitude should be "rework from scratch" instead of preserving current structure, consider it broken perf-wise
  - Nic: May implement a "flattened" version, will meet with Yuuichi
  - Christian: Important that this gets fixed
- Daniel: Paul brought up having some form of partition space for all execution space instances on arch (MultiGPU)
  - Christian: Eventually we need an interface of MultiGPU that uses pure Kokkos (not Cuda specific, e.g.)
  - Daniel, Christian: Paul should propose a version of this interface, maybe consider multiple different ways
- Damien: We should bump up min version for GTEST
  - Damien: Proposing snapshotting full release version in tpl/
  - Damien: Wants to get it in release
  - Damien: GMock is powerful
  - Damien: Proposing 1.14.0
  - All: supportive
