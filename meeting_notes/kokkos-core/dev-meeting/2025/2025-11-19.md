## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - JOSS Kokkos 4 paper
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)

## Notes

- CI: Looks good, Jenkins (ORNL) CUDA is in a good state. Nightlies look ok.
- Release: 5.0 is out since Monday.
  - Announcements on CEA, ORNL, SNL, LANL, JSC are out. Daniel will put it on the ANL slack.
  - Some slides are still missing, please make this a high priority **Assignee: ALL**
- Yearly Developers meeting.
  - We are thinking about another one this year.
  - Earliest would be December but we want to get a feel for when is a good time. Januar seems to be pretty full and the federal budget ends on end of January.
  - December is problematic for CEA, January is problematic with vacation and tutorials/mext/etc.
  - Feb 9-13 could be an option if the US-based people are allowed to travel. **Assignee:** Luc will circle the timeslot
 
- Round Table:
  - Prateek: working on finding applications that use MD range and how much they slow down.
  - Adrien: working on MD range issue. **Needs Reviews for 8638** Found a bug: The custom type is size-limited by the shared memory. We should throw an exception in this case. PR #7445 of Daniel solves that.
  - Bruno: Rocm 7.1 issues, tries to find the best way forward.
  - Elisabeth: no response
  - Hari: MD range for serial execution (tiles). Writes logic for iterating through a grid coordinated with Nic.
  - Nathan: Trilinos testing. Includes Stokhos updates that Christian made yesterday, looks promising so far.
  - Jakob: Neon and sve detection #8667. The discussion seems to favor that it is limited to arch native only. This will be problematic in cross compilation though.
  - Luc: CI updates on Kokkos-Kernels.
  - Nic: MD range flattening implementation. Focusing on Host first and Device later.
  - Paul: DDC, no Kokkos work right now.
  - Trevis: DDC, no Kokkos work except reviews and release briefing.
  - Daniel: tries to get #7445  over the line, **Need Reviews**. #8687 hopefully will be merged soon. #8626 which makes sure that we really fence at execution space destruction is blocked on #8687.
