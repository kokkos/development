  - CDash at https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Kokkos

  Issues:
  - oneAPI plugins for CUDA and HIP don't seem to be provided anymore by Codeplay
  - Cuda 12.2 builds occasionally fail trying to use a non-existing file
  - Cuda+Clang occasionally fails seemingly missing to link against libcuda 

## 4.7.2 Release
  - Span of 0-sized, padded views produces incorrect values: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8460
  - Fix compiling with nvcc-13 and C++20: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8562

## 5.0 CI and Code Prep

  [Kokkos-5.0 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8265)
  
  ### Release Planning
  - Release Manager: Trevis

## To Discuss / Resolve

approved pull requests: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved
- https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8586: Remove KOKKOS_COMPILER_APPLECC
- https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/7445: Check that exceeding team_size_max and scratch_size_max fails
  
### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629
  - Refactoring of device iterate tile https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction (blocker for tile size tuning) https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
  - Unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632

- MDRangePolicy benchmarks
  - Stream like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8462
  - Stencil like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8458
  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - JOSS Kokkos 4 paper
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)

## Notes

- CI: ORNL Jenkins still not working for Cuda. Library symbols are not found and so far we don't know why. Daniel and Jakob have not been able to reproduce despite several attempts.
- 4.7.02: Will probably do it with the list of things above but will be delayed to december
- 5.0:
  - Testing: Legacy view needs some fixing in Trilinos, but PRs are up. Intrepid shows some failures that Nathan still has to investigate. Stokhos still problematic. TUG is working on updating their compilers to be c++20 ready.
  - Nic would want https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8612 to be in the release.
- Release briefing: Trevis will hopes to finish the plan/announcement this week. Target for the release is in the week of Thanksgiving (last week of november)
- 8586: Do we care about AppleClang vs other clang. Right now we don't use it. Christian wants to have AppleClang identified as different compiler from clang. Nic says they have different version numbering. A short investigation reveals that the numbering is different thus we want to identify it. -> we close 8586
- 7445: `team/scratch_size_max` throw exceptions but we might want to abort. **Needs more reviews**
- MDRangePolicy: For now development is focused on GPUs. Should focus on improving the basic implementation first before getting into unrolling etc. Maybe starting from scratch is a good approach in this case.
  - 8629 tries unrolling
  - 8638 refactors the device iterations
  - **Assignee: Nic** for CPU side
- 8462: now is 27s **Assignee: Christian** for a review
- Times until furlow: SNL probably until end of December, LANL probably end of November, ORNL no one knows
