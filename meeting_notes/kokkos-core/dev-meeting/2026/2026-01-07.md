## Releases
  - 5.0.1: Up on github since yesterday [5.0.1](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/releases/tag/5.0.1)
  - 5.1.0: Anything to prioritize?

## To Discuss / Resolve

approved pull requests: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved
  
### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)
  - Refactoring of device iterate tile https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638
    * PR completely ready for review (asymmetric thread mapping issue addressed), drastically reduces the register pressures (Highest priority)
  - Iterating in MDRangePolicy without tiles for Serial backend https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8721
    * People's thoughts are needed
    * Identified that the performace issue stems from vectorization. Please, refer to these comments in issue [\#8652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652):  [3642147546](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3642147546), [3649050316](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3649050316), [3664601865](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3664601865)

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
    * Demonstrate the differences between host and device reduction capabilities for these edge cases. (Stalled)
  - "Local" unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- MDRangePolicy benchmarks
  - Stream like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8462
      * PR updated using the macro to disable heavy benchmarks (Priority)
  - Stencil like https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8458 (Merged)
   
- Support for ROCm 7.1
  - What do we want to do with hipAsyncMalloc: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8708
  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- [7319](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7319): Systematic API review for deprecation in preparation of Kokkos 5.0
  - [7532](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/7532): `create_mirror*` functions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
- MDSpan precondition error handlilng https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8320 (Nicolas)
 - Blog posts for releases? (Nicolas)

## Notes

### Upcoming Community event
 - Kokkos Training at CEA: all is ready

 - Tutorial at HPCAsia: mostly set

 - Community Summit: everything under control

 - Kokkos developers meeting 
   - Will take place in Albuquerque
   - Adjacent to HPSF, week after not possible due to C++ conf, so it will be the week prior
   - Need to secure a room
   - It is not know yet if it is the whole week or not, depends on number of people present
   - Last time in Oakridge was productive, Christian hope a significant proportion of the Core developers will be able to attend

   - Needs to be discussed at CEA, to know how many people will come
   - Prateek will ask people at Juelich

 - HPSF Conf
   - Daniel will submit "CI approach to Kokkos"
   - Jakob will submit the second one
   - Christian will submit "Heterogeneous" one
   - Nic will submit the MDspan one
   - Carl will sumbit "Navigating Hardware Evolution in the Kokkos Ecosystem"
   - someone from Patrick team will submit "Automatic Translation of Fortran to Kokkos"
     
Papers that get rejected can be proposed to the Kokkos user group

### CI
Nothing to report

### Releases
 - 5.1.0, a bit before HPSF, early march
#### Priorities:
 - MDrange performances, still needs to:
    - merge bench PR
    - merge refactor/simplification PR
    - take tiling into account (less urgent because it is a rarer use case than no tiling)

 - Self similar parallel range interface (#8367 as initial work, needs a lot of follow up work)  
Biggest improvement to the core API done in a long time: Christian wants as much feedback as possible from as many people as possible

 - Support for ROCm7.1

 - Problem with 13.1 cuda  
More than half the tests can't compile (problem with MDSpan, segfaults in nvcc)  
Warning in cmake or blacklist this version?  
Should be added to the doc in the "known issue" page

### Other discussions
 - simd benchs PR (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/7932)
    - nothing left blocking, tests were relaunched.

 - EXPECT for device (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8768)
    - should it be public? Christian and Prateek think that it should. Maybe put it in a tests_utilities file that get installed along Kokkos to avoid people copying it around.
    - name should change (it should be less generic, include Kokkos)
    - need to find a way to avoid reduction over specifically named variable (Kokkos::ErrorReport?)
    - error message get mangled if several threads raise error at the same time

 - Hari would like people to look at an open ended issue to share ideas: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652
