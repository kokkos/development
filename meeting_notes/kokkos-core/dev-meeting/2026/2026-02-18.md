## Releases
  - 5.1.0:
    - Release in a little more than two weeks. So everything that is not in a good state now will probably not make it. We might want to see which open PRs we prioritize.
    - We should start looking for a release manager

### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Iterating in MDRangePolicy without tiles for Serial backend https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8721
    * Issue [\#8652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652). Identified that the performace issue stems from vectorization.
    * An implementation of nested for loops with less indirection, which still doesn't lead to speed-up: https://github.com/science-enthusiast/kokkos/tree/ser-mdrp-less-indir-strip
      Refer to `core/src/Serial/Kokkos_Serial_Parallel_MDRange.hpp` and `core/src/impl/KokkosExp_Host_IterateNestLoopWoTile.hpp`.
    * On the other hand, a raw implementation of nested for loops that somehow allows auto-vectorization: https://godbolt.org/z/fdPa34nPY
      It will be good to understand what is going on. 
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
    * Demonstrate the differences between host and device reduction capabilities for these edge cases. (Stalled)
  - "Local" unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- Self similar interface https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8367
  - Want to make progress on these and then follow up

## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.
