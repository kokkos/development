## To Discuss / Resolve

approved pull requests: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved
- "Enable cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions" (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8689) blocked on "Cleanup ScatterValue" (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8761)
  
### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)
  - Refactoring of device iterate tile https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638
    * PR completely ready for review (asymmetric thread mapping issue addressed), drastically reduces the register pressures (Highest priority)
    * SYCL issues
  - Iterating in MDRangePolicy without tiles for Serial backend https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8721
    * People's thoughts are needed
    * Identified that the performace issue stems from vectorization. Please, refer to these comments in issue [\#8652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652):  [3642147546](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3642147546), [3649050316](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3649050316), [3664601865](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3664601865)

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
    * Demonstrate the differences between host and device reduction capabilities for these edge cases. (Stalled)
  - "Local" unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- Self similar interface https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8367
  - Want to make progress on these and then follow up

  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.

## Notes

- CEA training
  - Went good overall
  - Fixed some bugs in the hackathon code
  - Found some missing documentation in Kokkos 
- HPSF community summit
  - Nothing to report for now
  - CFP is still open
- Developer meeting
  - 4 people from ORNL going (Damien, Jakob, Seyong, Daniel)
  - 3-4 people from CEA, should ask Julien for the exact list
  - Format:
    - How many days do we want it to be?
    - Should be an opportunity for getting everyone in sync, set priorities, etc (2 days for this?)
    - Reserve some time for team building and to get to know each other
    - Maybe add a hackathon-style exercise to evaluate understanding of the code base by the core devs
    - Maybe make the beginning of the week facultative so that we can accomodate people arriving late
- HPSF conf
  - Every talk submitted on our side was accepted
  - KUG:
    - schedule is done
    - waiting for comfirmation for one of the training related talks
    - session chairs have not been chosen yet
    - still have to fill the two panel sessions and select the panelists
      - maybe do a feedback session (like KUG 2023) instead of a qa session for the last panel session
      - more informal
- CI
  - Some problems with the SNL cuda jobs, might get some spurious system failures
  - Need to see why the NetxSilicon CI is not reporting as passing
- Releases
  - Trilinos wanted a 5.0.2, all related issues should have been merged by now
  - 5.1
    - Progress on the math functions, we would ideally want all of them in 5.1
    - Maybe change the default MDRange tile size for cuda, hip and sycl
- Priority
  - Mostly MDRange related stuff
  - SYCL failures (maybe non-deterministic) in the device iterate tile PR https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638
    - Would be nice if we got this into 5.1
  - Exploring unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629: paused until https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8638 is merged
  - Self similar interface https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8367
    - need more feedback on this
    - would be the basis for other follow-up PRs
