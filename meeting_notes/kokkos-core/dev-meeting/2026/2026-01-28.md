## Releases
  - 5.0.2: Ready to release after Trilinos testing?
  - 5.1.0: Anything to prioritize?

## To Discuss / Resolve

approved pull requests: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved
- "Enable cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions" (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8689) blocked on "Cleanup ScatterValue" (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8761)
- We need to assign tentative session chairs for KUG
  
### Priority

- MDRangePolicy performance improvement is high priority
  - Exploring Unrolling https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8629 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)
  - Iterating in MDRangePolicy without tiles for Serial backend https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8721
    * People's thoughts are needed
    * Identified that the performace issue stems from vectorization. Please, refer to these comments in issue [\#8652](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652):  [3642147546](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3642147546), [3649050316](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3649050316), [3664601865](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8652#issuecomment-3664601865)

- MDRangePolicy Issues
  - Fix custom reduction https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8647
    * Demonstrate the differences between host and device reduction capabilities for these edge cases. (Stalled)
  - "Local" unrolling semantics proposal https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/8632 (Paused. To be resumed after more fundamental changes in MDRangePolicy.)

- Self similar interface https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/8367
  - Want to make progress on these and then follow up

  
## Publications

- Possible papers we could focus on
  - New Kokkos ecosystem paper mentioning new efforts and the transition to HPSF
    - waiting for Comm blog post, and maybe Fortran Interop
  - Maybe a paper to describe how Kokkos is evolving in response to the unified memory advent (APUs, HMM, etc.)
- Technical blog posts

## Bigger discussions
- backend-specific properties:
  - [6496](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6496): SYCL: Allow setting subgroup size
- type-safe scratch memory space:
  - [5879](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/5879): Allow specifying scratch level for ScratchSpace at compile-time
- memory space design:
  - [6835](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/pull/6835): Remove MemorySpace::[de]allocate overloads without labels
  - [6918](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/6918): kokkos_malloc should accept an execution space instance
- Rethink the containers: They were designed in another age and it would be good to revise/rethink them. This might be a discussion for the time of v5-v6.

## Notes
- Participation info for SNL dev meeting needed, please update [issue](https://github.com/kokkos/development/issues/22) if you are attending
- CI working group: More crayclang failures on frontier
  - Vendor recommends using AMDclang instead
  - Bruno has reported problem
  - Maybe drop testing if vendor doesn not care, we have no known users
- 5.0.2: release candidate is ready
- KUG organization. Jakob will update blog post
  - Introduction: Christian, Damien, and Luc
  - Kokkos in Applications: Nevin
  - Adopting Kokkos: Conrad
  - Teaching and Training: Jakob
  - Tuning and Performance: Daniel
  - Kokkos Session: Nic
  - Kokkos and Fortran: Patrik
- Self-similar interface
  - space() should be the function name for both exec_space and team_handle
  -  Conrad will make updates
  -  That PR should be in a good state, just needs more reviews
- PR 8827
  - Nathan volunteers to run on kokkos-dev-2 with cuda 12.9 (lowest version which supports math comp funcs from PR) and cudaclang20
- Patrik: Kokkos 5 paper?
  - Christian: 3 paper was at the end of 3, so basically a kokkos 4 paper
  - Christian: Less new features from 4 -> 5, so might be better to wait longer for journal paper
  - Christian: New features around the corner: Graph, self-similar interface, new backends, etc.
